        "timestamp_agent_trace": "System: I need you to meticulously identify ALL slide transitions in this video, even if they seem minor. A slide transition happens whenever the content on the presentation changes.\n    Here's what I need you to do for EACH transition:\n    1. Give me the timestamp. \n    2. Describe the visual change in a sentence or two. For example: \"A new slide appears with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage in large, bold font at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list.\"\n    3. If it's a minor change, like an animation, new plot, or revealing a new bullet point, then you must say \"Type: MINOR CHANGE\". If it's an entirely new slide then you must say \"Type: NEW SLIDE\" and tell me why you think it's a new slide. For example: \"This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\"\n    4. Pay special attention to identify if it could be the end of the lecture and indicate with \"Type: END OF LECTURE\". Make a note if the speaker stops talking for an extended period since that might be the conclusion. Make a note if there is any mention of 'taking questions' which could indicate its the concluding slide. Do not submit any timestamps after the speaker has concluded the presentation and it is the question-and-answer period. \n    Be as detailed as possible! I want to be absolutely sure we don't miss any slide changes.\n    Example:\n    \"04:30: The screen transitions to a slide with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage' at the top.

A slide transition happens whenever the content on the presentation changes.\n    Here's what I need you to do for EACH transition:\n    1. Give me the timestamp. \n    2. Describe the visual change in a sentence or two. For example: \"A new slide appears with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage in large, bold font at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list.\"\n    3. If it's a minor change, like an animation, new plot, or revealing a new bullet point, then you must say \"Type: MINOR CHANGE\". If it's an entirely new slide then you must say \"Type: NEW SLIDE\" and tell me why you think it's a new slide. For example: \"This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\"\n    4. Pay special attention to identify if it could be the end of the lecture and indicate with \"Type: END OF LECTURE\". Make a note if the speaker stops talking for an extended period since that might be the conclusion.

A slide transition happens whenever the content on the presentation changes.\n    Here's what I need you to do for EACH transition:\n    1. Give me the timestamp. \n    2. Describe the visual change in a sentence or two. For example: \"A new slide appears with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage in large, bold font at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list.\"\n    3. If it's a minor change, like an animation, new plot, or revealing a new bullet point, then you must say \"Type: MINOR CHANGE\". If it's an entirely new slide then you must say \"Type: NEW SLIDE\" and tell me why you think it's a new slide. For example: \"This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\"\n    4. Pay special attention to identify if it could be the end of the lecture and indicate with \"Type: END OF LECTURE\". Make a note if the speaker stops talking for an extended period since that might be the conclusion. Make a note if there is any mention of 'taking questions' which could indicate its the concluding slide. Do not submit any timestamps after the speaker has concluded the presentation and it is the question-and-answer period. \n    Be as detailed as possible! I want to be absolutely sure we don't miss any slide changes.\n    Example:\n    \"04:30: The screen transitions to a slide with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage' at the top.
