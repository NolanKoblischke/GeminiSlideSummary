        "timestamp_agent_trace": "System: I need you to meticulously identify ALL slide transitions in this video, even if they seem minor. A slide transition happens whenever the content on the presentation changes.\n    Here's what I need you to do for EACH transition:\n    1. Give me the timestamp. \n    2. Describe the visual change in a sentence or two. For example: \"A new slide appears with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage in large, bold font at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list.\"\n    3. If it's a minor change, like an animation, new plot, or revealing a new bullet point, then you must say \"Type: MINOR CHANGE\". If it's an entirely new slide then you must say \"Type: NEW SLIDE\" and tell me why you think it's a new slide. For example: \"This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\"\n    4. Pay special attention to identify if it could be the end of the lecture and indicate with \"Type: END OF LECTURE\". Make a note if the speaker stops talking for an extended period since that might be the conclusion. Make a note if there is any mention of 'taking questions' which could indicate its the concluding slide. Do not submit any timestamps after the speaker has concluded the presentation and it is the question-and-answer period. \n    Be as detailed as possible! I want to be absolutely sure we don't miss any slide changes.\n    Example:\n    \"04:30: The screen transitions to a slide with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage' at the top. A diagram depicting a network architecture with various boxes and arrows fills the majority of the slide. This is a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide about Proper Motion.

The slide features a text box with the title \"Concluding:\" and the following bullet points: \"We implement a new prescription for PPISN mass loss\", \"Our fiducial version does not match with observations\", \"Motivated modifications lead to a match BUT they are in tension with other observables\", \"More likely that the bump is not caused by PPISN*\", and \"This has strong implications for other studies!\". To the right of the text box is a diagram depicting a star with several arrows pointing towards and away from it. This is a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide. **Type: NEW SLIDE**\n\n**48:39:** The speaker concludes the presentation and the host begins taking questions. **Type: END OF LECTURE** \n\nInternal Tool Received: submit_slide_transitions(['43:08', '44:15', '44:49', '46:03', '47:41'])\n"

        "timestamp_agent_trace": "System: I need you to meticulously identify ALL slide transitions in this video, even if they seem minor. A slide transition happens whenever the content on the presentation changes.\n    Here's what I need you to do for EACH transition:\n    1. Give me the timestamp. \n    2. Describe the visual change in a sentence or two. For example: \"A new slide appears with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage in large, bold font at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list.\"\n    3. If it's a minor change, like an animation, new plot, or revealing a new bullet point, then you must say \"Type: MINOR CHANGE\". If it's an entirely new slide then you must say \"Type: NEW SLIDE\" and tell me why you think it's a new slide. For example: \"This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\"\n    4. Pay special attention to identify if it could be the end of the lecture and indicate with \"Type: END OF LECTURE\". Make a note if the speaker stops talking for an extended period since that might be the conclusion. Make a note if there is any mention of 'taking questions' which could indicate its the concluding slide. Do not submit any timestamps after the speaker has concluded the presentation and it is the question-and-answer period. \n    Be as detailed as possible! I want to be absolutely sure we don't miss any slide changes.\n    Example:\n    \"04:30: The screen transitions to a slide with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage' at the top. A diagram depicting a network architecture with various boxes and arrows fills the majority of the slide. This is a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide about Proper Motion. Type: NEW SLIDE\"\n    \nSystem: Here's the video for 00:00-07:00\nAssistant: 00:01: A title slide appears with the title \"SpectraFM\" in large, white font. Below the title is the subtitle \"Tuning into stellar foundation models\" in a smaller font. Below the subtitle are the names of the presenters and the name of the workshop. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\n00:05: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"Stellar Spectra\" at the top. Three images of telescopes fill the top of the slide. Below the images is a bulleted list and a graph depicting a normalized spectrum. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide.\n01:28: The screen transitions to a page from a scientific paper. The title of the paper is \"A measurement of the distance to the Galactic centre using the kinematics of bar stars\". Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide.\n01:40: The screen transitions to a page from a different scientific paper. The title of the paper is \"A Dynamical heating across the Milky Way disc using APOGEE and Gaia\". Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide.\n02:00: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"Motivating Problem\" at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide.\n02:09: A scatter plot and a histogram appear on the right side of the slide. The title \"Neural Network Trained from Scratch\" appears above the scatter plot. Type: MINOR CHANGE. The speaker is still discussing the same topic, but a new visual aid has been added to the slide.\n03:06: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"Pre-training & Foundation Models\" at the top. Below the title are two lines of text and a bulleted list. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide.\n03:40: Three images appear at the bottom of the slide, one of a dog, one of a galaxy, and one of a galaxy survey. Below the images are the labels \"ImageNet\", \"GalaxyZoo DESI\", and \"JWST CEERS Survey\". A graph depicting \"JWST\" performance appears on the right side of the slide. Type: MINOR CHANGE. The speaker is still discussing the same topic, but new visual aids have been added to the slide.\n04:30: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"Pre-training for Spectra\" at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide.\n04:31: A diagram depicting a network architecture with various boxes and arrows fills the majority of the slide. Type: MINOR CHANGE.

The title \"Pre-training for Spectra\" remains at the top of the slide. Type: MINOR CHANGE. The speaker is still discussing the same topic, but a new visual aid has been added to the slide.\n07:08: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"Fine-tuning on [Fe/H]\" at the top. Three scatter plots appear on the slide, each depicting the predicted vs. actual values for iron abundance.

A table depicting the RMSE for each abundance appears above the scatter plots. Type: NEW SLIDE.
