Dr. David Hendriks of the University of Surrey delivered a lecture on the role of pulsational pair-instability supernovae in electromagnetic and gravitational-wave transients. The lecture delved into the statistical properties of black hole mergers, particularly focusing on the unexpected mass distribution of these objects, and explored the potential for pair-instability supernovae as a significant contributor to the observed population. 

Firstly, the speaker presented a compelling argument for the emergence of a new era in gravitational-wave astronomy.  With the increasing number of detections since 2015, gravitational-wave observatories have acquired sufficient data for statistical analysis. This allows for the construction of distributions, like the distribution of black hole masses, which offer invaluable insights into the processes that generate these compact objects.

The lecture then highlighted a peculiar feature of the observed black hole mass distribution â€“ a bump centered around 35 solar masses.  Hendriks proposed that pulsational pair-instability supernovae, a type of stellar explosion characterized by intense pulsations and pair production, could account for this bump. He explained that these supernovae occur when a massive star reaches a critical stage in its evolution, leading to a catastrophic ejection of its outer layers and leaving behind a black hole. The unique physics of pair-instability supernovae, which involve a delicate balance between energy production and radiation pressure, results in the creation of black holes with masses clustered around 35 solar masses. 

Finally, the lecture discussed the broader implications of this research.  Hendriks argued that, if pulsational pair-instability supernovae are indeed a major contributor to the black hole population, it could have significant implications for our understanding of stellar evolution, galaxy formation, and the evolution of binary systems. Further investigations into the role of pair-instability supernovae, he concluded, are crucial to unravel the mysteries surrounding the origin and evolution of black hole mergers and their implications for the cosmic landscape.
