And that core is just going to most of the time it'll just hang out and cool off forever. Not doing a lot of nuclear fusion. Um so for our purposes, that was not helpful. That has not made an element. It has certainly not made one that we can see. It all got trapped in this core. So instead we need to look at more massive stars. So these are stars that are about 10 times the mass of the sun or more. Um So, the mass of the sun is about 300,000 earths. Um And so, these are about 3 million earths up to maybe even 10 million um earths by mass."

                "text": "So, these massive stars fuse elements in their core by once again, an alpha process. So, uh it's called this because every single step of this chain is just going to be adding a helium over and over and over again. So, the star at this point has mostly a core of carbon, containing a bit of oxygen. Lots of helium knocking around still. And so, one of those helium nuclei will just get stuck onto a carbon nucleus and they'll fuse. So, I'll keep doing this for a while. Once it runs out of carbon, it uh  sorry, makes oxygen and produces energy. And once it runs out of carbon, it can start doing this to oxygen. Just start tacking helium onto that. And then, we can tack helium onto neon and we've just made And we can just keep going and going for a while anyways. This process has to stop at uh iron and nickel. No matter how massive the star is. Um The reason that it's because iron uh and nickel are very very stable. It is really hard to change an iron nucleus in any way. It's hard to take anything away. It's hard to add anything. Um It requires energy. And nickel is one of those magic numbers that we love so much. Um and so, we can't just start putting helium on forever, because now we have no fusion. Nothing is nothing is stopping gravity now. Um There is truly no hope for this star. So, it's left with this core of iron ash and all of these other layers of the elements that it fused by this alpha process. And there's nothing to support it. And so the core starts to contract and honestly, if they are massive enough, they don't just contract, they completely collapse. Um The iron ash gets compressed into something something impossibly dense core. And these outer layers are rocketing towards the core at up to like 25% the speed of light. Um and when they hit the core, they're just going to ricochet right off. Um And this is called the core collapse supernova. We think this is something like what it might look like. Um So, the energy involved in something like this is approximately equivalent to 2,500 billion years' worth of energy from the sun. Um So, there's a lot going on. There's certainly enough to uh fuse heavier elements than iron. Right? We needed an injection an injection of energy in some way to get past this barrier. And now we have it. By just completely destroying our star. So, this ricocheting off the core is going to produce a shock wave. Um And you can see that to propagate outwards. And as that uh shock wave expands and it's passing through these outer layers which already had some heavier elements in them. Right? These are layers that have neon and oxygen and silicon and things like that. uh It's going to take those and fuse them all together in very messy messy ways. Um And those outer layers escape. They get returned to the environment that the star was born in. Now, most of the iron that we made actually gets trapped um it does not escape. It got stuck in the core, never to be seen from again. Um But that's okay because we can make some of the outer layers, too. Uh That's not you know, that's not a big deal. And so these massive stars by this process uh can make elements up until about uh rubidium. Ignore those three. Um Up until about rubidium which has 37 protons. Um which is great, we only have 81 more le 81 more to go. Um and they make a lot of even numbered elements specifically, because when we were fusing elements by the alpha process we're adding two helium at a time. Um And they make then lots of magnesium. Lots of silicon, things like that. Um And while they do make iron while they live and also while they die. So they make some of the iron that we see. They are not actually responsible for most of it. That goes instead to low mass exploding stars um which make the bulk of elements like iron and nickel um and zinc."

So, we don't really care all that much about them. Um They don't collapse like massive stars do after they are done fusing in their core. Um because they're supported by a special kind of like quantum mechanical pressure. So, electrons cannot have the same quantum mechanical configuration as each other. Um And you can think of this as a parking lot where every electron needs its own parking space. And when we have lots of spaces, there're not that many free electrons floating around. This is not a problem. This is not relevant. But uh the core has gotten really dense. Right? Gravity is still trying to push it together. And so, now our electrons are"

But, we talked a little bit earlier, like you can't just add stuff to a nucleus and expect it to all work out. And, so most of the time when you make a nucleus this way, it's going to be unstable, and it's going to have to decay, and what ends up happening is that the neutron spontaneously converts to a proton, and the nucleus sheds an electron and what's called an antineutrino. Um, which is great for us because we've added a proton. We've made a new element."

They're not just like out and about during hydrogen fusion, so we need some sort of neutron source. We need a way to generate free neutrons uh that can be like available and ready to use for this process. And, there are two different ways to do this. The first is to have some sort of special fusion reaction um that is going to as a byproduct, produce a lot of free neutrons. Or, we can crush protons, or protons and electrons so close together that the subatomic particles that make them up rearrange themselves into neutrons."

A slow neutron capture process, and then a rapid neutron capture process. So, the slow neutron capture process is called the s-process uses this special fusion reaction um to get a bunch of free neutrons floating around. And, this is a little bit more relaxed, and so, it's going to make most of the lighter heavier elements. That makes sense. So, we're going to start at uh about strontium, that's the first one we start to see from this process, which has 38 protons."

Um, and we'll make things all the way up until about lead and bismuth, um which have 82 and 83 protons respectively. So that's pretty good. We're like making progress finally. Um, and the s-process is considered slow because the time it takes to actually add this neutron um is quite long compared to the time it takes the unstable nucleus to decay. Meaning we really can only do this more or less one at a time. Capture a neutron, let it decay, capture a neutron, let it decay. Um, and we'll sort of get a little bit stuck at those magic numbers. They'll wait a little bit longer, maybe capture some extra neutrons before decaying."

So, this is after they have uh a nice carbon core, but before they have turned into white dwarfs that are hanging out forever. Um, and so at this point in this star's life, we have a carbon and oxygen core, a layer of helium that sometimes lights on fire. Honestly, sometimes it burns, and then a layer of hydrogen that also is burning a little bit, but mostly just a ton of non-burning like cold hydrogen on the outside."

Other stars do this during their life um like if a star being convective is pretty normal, but this stage is unique because usually convection is like confined to its own layer. So, the hydrogen uh in that outer layer will cycle, but it's only cycling with itself. But, this one is special because it can like reach down into the core and like actually scoops stuff up and what we end up with is a weird little bubble of carbon that has been scooped up out of the core and "

That does not seem helpful but just like uh a neutron capture can produce a proton proton capture can produce uh can produce a neutron. And so, that's more or less what ends up happening in our little carbon bubble. I'm going to skip details for brevity um but by capturing a proton, the carbon in that in that bubble uh is able to produce a lot of free neutrons um which can then get sort of tacked on to any heavy nucleus that was like already in the star to begin with. So, this starts that iron, just start adding a nucleus, sorry, adding a neutron like every couple of decades. Maybe, every 100 years, a nucleus will uh will gain a proton and be made into something heavier. Um and this process is totally fine to make all of these elements in purple. "
