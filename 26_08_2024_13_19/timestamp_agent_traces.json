        "timestamp_agent_trace": "System: I need you to meticulously identify ALL slide transitions in this video, even if they seem minor. A slide transition happens whenever the content on the presentation changes.\n    Here's what I need you to do for EACH transition:\n    1. Give me the timestamp. \n    2. Describe the visual change in a sentence or two. For example: \"A new slide appears with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage in large, bold font at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list.\"\n    3. If it's a minor change, like an animation, new plot, or revealing a new bullet point, then you must say \"Type: MINOR CHANGE\". If it's an entirely new slide then you must say \"Type: NEW SLIDE\" and tell me why you think it's a new slide. For example: \"This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\"\n    4. Pay special attention to identify if it could be the end of the lecture and indicate with \"Type: END OF LECTURE\". Make a note if the speaker stops talking for an extended period since that might be the conclusion. Make a note if there is any mention of 'taking questions' which could indicate its the concluding slide. Do not submit any timestamps after the speaker has concluded the presentation and it is the question-and-answer period. \n    Be as detailed as possible! I want to be absolutely sure we don't miss any slide changes.\n    Example:\n    \"04:30: The screen transitions to a slide with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage' at the top. A diagram depicting a network architecture with various boxes and arrows fills the majority of the slide. This is a new slide because the title, visual content, and layout are distinct from the previous slide about Proper Motion.

A slide transition happens whenever the content on the presentation changes.\n    Here's what I need you to do for EACH transition:\n    1. Give me the timestamp. \n    2. Describe the visual change in a sentence or two. For example: \"A new slide appears with the title 'Finding the Gaia Sausage in large, bold font at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list.\"\n    3. If it's a minor change, like an animation, new plot, or revealing a new bullet point, then you must say \"Type: MINOR CHANGE\". If it's an entirely new slide then you must say \"Type: NEW SLIDE\" and tell me why you think it's a new slide. For example: \"This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\"\n    4. Pay special attention to identify if it could be the end of the lecture and indicate with \"Type: END OF LECTURE\". Make a note if the speaker stops talking for an extended period since that might be the conclusion. Make a note if there is any mention of 'taking questions' which could indicate its the concluding slide.

This is clearly a new slide because the layout and content are completely different from the previous slide.\n31:51: The screen transitions to a slide with a photograph of the Milky Way galaxy. A speech bubble with the text \"WHAT ARE YOU??\" is superimposed on the image. The text \"Me, at work\" is to the right of the speech bubble. The text \"Finkbeiner 2003\" is at the bottom left corner of the slide. The text \"Credit: Two Micron All Sky Survey\" is at the bottom right corner of the slide. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the layout and content are completely different from the previous slide.\n32:10: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"What kind of clouds cause scintillation?\" at the top. Below the title are four boxes, each depicting a different type of cloud that can cause scintillation. The boxes are labeled \"Supernova remnants\", \"HII regions\", \"Bow Shocks\", and \"Solar Winds\". Each box contains an image of the type of cloud it depicts. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\n33:54: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"Measuring Scintillating Clouds\" at the top. Below the title is a bulleted list with the items \"Distance\", \"Velocity\", and \"Shape\". To the left of the list is a graph depicting the brightness of a pulsar over time at different wavelengths. The y-axis is labeled \"wavelength\" and the x-axis is labeled \"time\". To the right of the list is a 3D plot depicting the distance, velocity, and shape of scintillating clouds. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide. \n\nInternal Tool Received: submit_slide_transitions(['30:14', '31:43', '31:51', '32:10', '33:54'])\n\nSystem: Here's the video for 35:00-42:00\nAssistant: Assistant: 35:00: The video begins with a slide titled \"Measuring Scintillating Clouds\". On the left is a graph depicting the brightness of a pulsar over time at different wavelengths. On the right is a 3D plot depicting the distance, velocity, and shape of scintillating clouds. Type: MINOR CHANGE. This is a minor change because the video starts with this slide.\n35:07: The screen transitions to a slide with the title \"Comparing with Interstellar Clouds\". The slide contains a graph depicting the brightness of gas in the Milky Way galaxy. A red circle indicates the location of a pulsar, and a red dotted line indicates the direction of scattering. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the title, layout, and content are completely different from the previous slide.\n35:50: The screen transitions to the same slide as before, but the graph is replaced with a new graph depicting the brightness of gas in the Milky Way galaxy in a different color scheme. The red circle and dotted line remain in the same position. Type: MINOR CHANGE. This is a minor change because the majority of the slide remains the same, with only the graph being replaced.\n36:46: The screen transitions to a slide with a 3D plot depicting the location of pulsars and a supernova remnant. The pulsars are represented by dots, and the supernova remnant is represented by a pink blob. Type: NEW SLIDE. This is clearly a new slide because the layout and content are completely different from the previous slide.\n38:16: The speaker states \"And that's all I have for my talk if we want to move to questions\". Type: END OF LECTURE. The speaker has concluded the presentation and is ready to take questions. \n\n"
