And I mean And you know that I mean in the sense that it's very smooth. It doesn't it doesn't actually misbehave or Well yeah no right Yeah Yeah so underlying in this is just a handful of observations right Yeah Uh so And there is a reason there is a reason why this is such a smooth curve Yeah It's basically because they they fitted a power law plus peak model to to this curve to this set of observations And within the uncertainties of the observations that leads to the the sort of like the the regions spanned by this by this curve. There are other fits that people have made and even non-parametric fits uh but they all do find a feature in that same region. So this is not necessarily just a remnant of the fact that people impose a power law plus a Gaussian peak because then you will find something like a Gaussian peaks somewhere right But this is actually of all the also all the other models the simplest model that actually captures the feature that all of the models see. And otherwise it becomes an over- an over-fit model that you see. So many, so many things. Uh those are kind of thinking of you know if you had had people working on simulations in the past to do the same things like you know the the observations or the simulations that you were talking about And when you're talking about some of the some of the steps Yeah yeah yeah But so between like I go all the way back to the first like between the first data set that was uh released Basically all the 2 1 0 1 this curve This location of this peak was also found right So now with the increasing number of of of the increasing numbers uh things can get constrained but it it remains a feature in this location And even if there is a relatively simple fit made to it even with more complicated fits or non-parametric fits a feature is seen in that region right And it's relatively easy to uh to show that as the distribution with the side mark that this is actually behind there."

And in some supernova mechanisms it's also quite clear that the initial turbulence or convection has quite a big effect on the outcome of of these explosions right um So I think these results are fairly robust but a good set of three unit 3D models with the same global structures but different microstructures might be interesting to to lead to Yeah uh Yeah But I do think globally this is quite a robust result And find simulations like information on the star masters so when they have also found some white regions"

And then might actually well happen in these in these clusters because I'm not sure if it's even necessary to have these super super massive stars within the center of the cluster because this would only happen for something like 400 500 solar mass stars. Um And in your case if you get very massive stars you get something like a general relativistic instability that happen and just everything collapses onto a a black hole as well The problem is they're not in binaries and so it might be a bit difficult to to measure that or they're probably not as often in binaries as we need them to be to detect them in this way.

Uh so yeah, so the dataset that we're using to just as a prototype, prototype our foundation model, is the APOGEE spectroscopic survey. It's looked at hundreds of thousands of stars and got high-resolution spectra for each of them as well as, you know, some simple spectral properties or stellar properties like temperature and also chemical abundances. And this has been used for many, many years to train machine learning algorithms because of the size of the dataset. Here's just a few examples. Uh, you know, a neural network trained on hundreds of thousands of APOGEE spectra to predict distances. Scientifically useful, great. Another neural network trained on tens of thousands of APOGEE spectra to predict ages from astrochronology. Great, also scientifically useful. Um, but what if you don't have tens or hundreds of thousands stars to train a model for your task? What you want to use uh a neural network to do so."

        "text": "So, uh what if you only have 100 stars? This is very common. You launch a new instrument, you collect, you know, all your spectra, but you want to train a neural network and you only have 100 labels. You only have 100 iron abundances measured in this scenario. This is probably not going to cover the full distribution that you want your neural network to be good at. In this case, if they're all metal-rich stars, then training a neural network is going to lead to a model that's useless in the metal-poor range. Um, but there's some clever tricks to get around this. You need to find more data. Uh so you can leverage like synthetic spectra, spectra from different instruments, even uh different but similar tasks. Uh, you can train up a model that has a good general knowledge and then you can fine-tune it for this task and it hopefully will have a better start. And so, what I'm talking about is making a foundation model for stars that will be generally useful for problems like this. Uh, and there's you know, uh this has been shown before to work well for uh astrophysics. Um, the concept of a foundation model is don't start uh your neural network from scratch when you have a new task. Train a neural network on your new task that has already been trained on a similar task. Uh, and so, Mike Wansley showed that when or at all that when he had 100 JWST images of galaxies and he wanted to train a neural network to predict whether there is a spiral or not, um that when they started with a neural network that had already seen hundreds of thousands of Galaxy Zoo images it"

        "text": "led to a model that was much higher accuracy than a neural network trained from scratch on the 100 JWST images. That's not too surprising, but it shows that pre-training uh is, you know, a very effective method and to drive that point home he showed that even when you start with a neural network that was trained on real images of cats, dogs, and pianos, um and then fine-tuned that network on your JWST images, it was still better than starting with a neural network from random weights. And so, it seems like even if, you know, they're not that similar uh then uh it's still better to use a pre-trained model. Uh, so, how do we go about doing this for stars? So we wanted a model that can take in all the observations we have of a star and is capable of doing many different tasks. And so we found that transformer neural networks can vary their input size and so they were the optimal algorithm for our task compared to normal neural networks that have a fixed input size. And so, essentially uh this allows us to create a model that can take in spectra of size 100 or a thousand, uh it allows us to take in spectra from any instrument, any wavelength range, any resolution, um, and we do this by embedding the pixels individually. We embed their fluxes into an embedding space and their wavelengths. We also embed into the same embedding space according to a positional encoding, which we borrowed from language models. It's essentially how language models know the position of a word in a sentence. We use that but for wavelength and so it's continuous. So, you can give it any wavelength, which is very important. And by embedding the wavelength and the flux of a pixel and adding it in the embedding space and feeding that into the transformer, we suddenly have a transformer that can take in 100 Gaia spectra pixels or thousands of APOGEE spectrum pixels or both at the same time. And so, you really can give it any observations you have of a star and then request information about that star because it's also very flexible on the output as well. And so, you can train it to predict anything you have the training data for. And so, it makes a prediction and an uncertainty. Um, Okay. So, uh just to prototype our foundation model, um we train it on hundreds of thousands of APOGEE spectra to predict uh like stellar properties and just basic abundances like oxygen, magnesium and iron abundance. And just for testing purposes uh we train it on the full wavelength range of APOGEE for each star, but the first half we give it real APOGEE data and the second half we give it only synthetic data. So, synthetic spectra. Um, and this leaves uh the second half available for testing which you'll see later. But essentially, we train it"
